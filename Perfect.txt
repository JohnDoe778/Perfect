Perfect - Miracle of Sound

Talking with you while I'm all by myself
Voices stay silent to everyone else
You were my hero and you were my home
Till you left me so hurt and afraid, all alone
And maybe I'm a monster, but I am what you made
Those memories that hurt me, will fly apart and fade
And maybe I'm a monster, but I don't give a damn
For maybe I am perfect (perfect)
Just the way I am
I don't wanna feel, tell me was it worth it?
'Cause I don't give a damn, I don't wanna feel
Tell me that I'm perfect, just the way I am
So many changes, tear us apart
Sisters to strangers, you blew up my heart
We used to chase all the terrors away
But they live in my mind now and they're eager to prey
And maybe I'm a monster, but I am what you made
I'm pulling out the pins, and I'm about to detonate
And maybe I'm a monster, but I don't give a damn
For maybe I am perfect (perfect)
Just the way I am
I don't wanna feel, tell me was it worth it?
'Cause I don't give a damn, I don't wanna feel
Tell me that I'm perfect, just the way I am
And I trusted you, and I'm still trying to
But my heart is still exploding, corroding into shame
(Oh, you're perfect, don't cry, don't change)
I don't wanna feel, tell me was it worth it?
'Cause I don't give a damn, I don't wanna feel
Tell me that I'm perfect, just the way I am
I don't wanna feel, tell me was it worth it?
'Cause I don't give a damn, I don't wanna feel
Tell me that I'm perfect, just the way I am
Na-na-na na-na na-na, na-na-na na-na na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na, na-na-na na-na na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na, na-na-na na-na na-na
Na-na-na na-na na-na, na-na-na na-na na-na
